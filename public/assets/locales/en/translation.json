  "about_text": "I am a Junior Web Developer currently based in Berlin, with roots in a rural area of NRW, Germany. Throughout my career, I have explored various fields related to communication, such as PR, marketing, and journalism. However, my true passion has always been coding and building webpages. So, in early 2022, I overcame my fears and pursued my dream of learning JavaScript on my own. In April 2023, I successfully completed a 6-month Full-Stack Web Development course with CareerFoundry, where I gained expertise in MongoDB, Express, React, Node, and Angular. I am proud of the outstanding projects I have completed and the vast amount of new knowledge I have acquired during the course. I have never been more passionate and fired up about anything else before. It may sound huge, and it is! I am eager to join a brilliant team where I can contribute my skills and continue to grow. If you know of any opportunities, please take your time to review my projects and feel free to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you!",
