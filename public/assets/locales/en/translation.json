  "about_text": "I am a Web Developer currently based in Berlin, with roots in Cologne and a rural area of NRW, Germany. Throughout my career, I've explored various fields related to communication, including PR, marketing, and journalism. However, my true passion has always been coding and building web pages. Recently, I've pursued my dream and worked on several projects in JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, React, Node, and Angular. I am proud of the outstanding projects I have completed and the vast amount of new knowledge I've gained while working with specialist in the industry and multiple stakeholders with diverse interests. I've never been more passionate and fired up about anything else before. It may sound overwhelming, but it truly is! I am eager to join a brilliant team where I can contribute my skills and continue to grow. If you know of any opportunities, please take the time to review my projects and feel free to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you!",
